### EXTERIOR:

- Dominating Dam wall/scenery like this. https://i.imgur.com/sl0C3KC.jpeg
- Work on terrain/decorations around helicopter.
- Design it like an Obstacle Course.

##### Bridge Reference Images:

##### Bridge Plan: 
	- Metal girder SM can be reskinned, scale it bigger, use as bridge beams.
	- Design stone buttress/support things with bsp + texture.
	- Possibly better skin.
	- top level of the bridge with bsp too.


### STALKER ARENA:

- Heavy, dark, oppressive atmosphere
 (the atmos we had going on without fog was actually better from recollection).

##### Stalker Sex Dungeon:
	- 25% chance to spawn grafitti on the cell at the very end of each intersection. (Abandoned Idea)
	- 4-way cell cross.
	- Other corridors could look like repurposed store rooms or caves (more cages?).
	- Put stalker spawns in the roofs of all the cells? (vent/hole)	
	- Porn shoot room might want a filming equipment storage room or closet.


### CRAWLER PIT:

Progression = Hive style industrial walkways -> foreman office -> toilets -> Air Ducts -> canteen ->
		      extension room -> Hazard Room -> offices/Air Duct 2 -> Tilted room -> End.

##### Plan:
- Top level = https://i.imgur.com/yKUe5lB.jpg
- Lower flooded level = https://i.imgur.com/uQSQ8tf.jpg

brighter lighting, experimental dust/halo mesh spanning almost entire level.
Locker room at start with all weapons from previous level. 1-way small drop into main level:
	- Regular wave level with some parkour. (holes in floor/broken catwalks)
	- Top level has regular early wave spawns.
	- Lower level = knee-high murky water + FULL of crawlers.
	- Katana on lower level.
	- Elevator for lower->upper level access.

##### Toilet corridor:
	- Draft 2 = Thicker corridor, double doors at end, trap for noobs.
	- ventilation shaft to the left (foreshadowing). 
	- Repurpose fusebox decorations.

##### Hazard Room:
	- Decorated with pipes and grating.
	- Full of acid environmental damage (will change to electrical).
	- Requires careful navigation or objective to deactivate.
	- Wave of zeds.

##### Tilted Room:
	- Water pump obj - you could put a floating obj marker when you get near it.
	- Delete otherwise.	

##### End: 
	- Broken stairwell, through locked door.
	- Requires getting past a scrake and operating keypad.


### TIGHT FP:
	- 3 levels worth that progressively get harder.
	- Use the narrow pipes in floor to bump at crucial seconds. (2-3)
	- Aim = Frustrate Sharpshooters
	- Add broom closet to FP level 1
	- Extend roof at 3rd level end, railings + ladder + raised corridor for surprise Mario FP.

##### Tight FP Stair transitions:
	- https://i.imgur.com/coiUCTL.jpeg
	- Each stairwell, 7 flights of steps.
	- Each platform would have classic barricade/burning doorway for zed spawn.

##### To do:
Central pillar on both stairs is just 1 bsp, So delete it.
Replace with metal grill/fence meshes that you can see through.
Assuming we put decorations there and everything...
	- maybe lots of vertical pipes surrounded by mesh.
	- Water drops/rushing water sounds.
	- Make all the spawn points in the stairs proximity-based? (fp stair waves retriggerable?)

### TURBINE ROOM:

##### Plan:
- https://c7.alamy.com/comp/E5BG8M/hoover-dam-turbine-room-E5BG8M.jpg
- Checkpoint -> lower turbine -> Traverse wall -> upper turbine.

Current Turbine Room Dimensions:
	- bsp = 1200 height, 4000 width, 800 breadth (Add more breadth).

##### Lower Turbine:
- Loose combat wave (lower turbine). 
- zeds jump down from side entrances, mostly focused on opposite end.
- Upper Turbine area is restricted by some means (rubble?).
- Timed (FP) Door bursts open to wall so lower turbine is hold or die.
- Few obstacles, but lotsa pipes and wiring for the turbines.
- Maybe part see-through turbines? -> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110822682
								   -> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110822936

##### Upper Turbine:
- Defined walkway.
- Spawns should hopefully get really intense so it needs to be wide.
- obj = "Turbine Start-up Procedure: Stage 1/3"

##### Notes:
	people get lost on foundry & kfo-west because it doesn't make sense at all.
	Loud sound effects should clue you in at least. Sound design will be key.
	Even with obvious HUD people will ignore it :c (official maps work 'coz voice-overs)
	
	Use engine sounds.
	Stack more as it powers up further
	Maybe make some lights on it (dynamic lights).
	

### DAM WALL:

##### Plan:
- Spawns falling from top of wall, in front and behind.
- Plenty husks, sirens, fp, scrakes, bloats to knock off into the abyss.
- Burning city skyline art in background, or whirling blizzard.

Found equipment: Dwarfs Axe, ZED Blower, Seeker Six.

### PATRIARCH:

##### Plan:
- Helicopter on roof (via upper turbine -> dam wall access?) 
- It may get blown up. D'oh.
- Players escape via train cutscene KFO-Transit style.

##### Train:
	- Accessed via one last elevator or something fancy. 
	- Underground train station.
	- Pre checkpoint and respawn before ofc.
	- Train obj = power/fuel/weld
	- Players have to work together and hold out.

##### Boss:
	- When acheived, they escape via train and cutscene. 
	- Kevin reveals himself as a stowaway.
	- Players teleported to checkpoint secretly mid-cutscene.
	- Now aboard "moving" train (repeating scenery).
	- Players teleported to checkpoint secretly mid-cutscene.
	- Jump air resistance can be represented by horizontal PhsyicsVolume gravity.

##### Inspiration:
	- Taken from KF-Train, but improved, without shitty scaling on meshes and other visual bugs!

##### Sidenote: Myrmuz did once suggest blowing up the Dam on the escape cutscene Half Life style.
           rip budget, wait a minute, what budget? When do I get paid?


### GENERAL IDEAS:

##### Waterworks:
	- Helicopter crash has big horizontal smoke emitter.
	- various windows in the interior have a bright light with a similar smoke emitter.
	- Colour the smoke whitish? (frosty air)
##### WestLondon:
	- swirl emitters in the air.


### TO DO:

- reviewing installed lighting.
- extensions + decorations for vent shafts.
- Tight FP stairs spawns.
- Tight FP 3, Mario corridor.
- Tight FP 1, Broom Closet.
- Check all zone portals.
- Hazard room needs reviewing, electrical and such.
- Dumb lever obj for the pump (HUD icon or delete)
- Review puter room/call elevator objective too.


### GARBAGE/DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE:

Boss Arena:
 [h1][b]General Information[/b][/h1]
This remake fixes some nasty original map [b][i]features[/i][/b].
[spoiler]for more info spam comments section[/spoiler]
[list]
[*] Patriarch's spawn in tested, delayed intervals (usually as pairs).
[*] Built-in voteable Hard Mode.
[*] Amounts of dosh given feels more balanced.
[*] There's a second level, with planks, cover and all your wildest dreams.
[*] Additional armour and high tier weapon pickups (with consistent spawn % for all difficulties).
[*] Scripted pipe bombs near blocked off Patty spawns.
[*] Addressed zed pathing issues.
[*] And more fun additions such as a replacement for the siren wave.
[/list]


[h1][b]Whitelist Status[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] Dedicated server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Listened server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Solo: (and you guessed it) Still whitelisted.
[/list]


[h1][b]Technical Information[/b][/h1]
① This is simply a map, no embedded mutators or whatever. To edit/remove pipe bombs search for the tag "PipeSpawner" in the actor class browser and delete or navigate to the scripted triggers -> AI Script.
② 'SkipWave' event command will skip to next trader (but use at own risk on normal mode).
③ The optional Hard Mode features pat spawns without timed intervals, for the classic BossArena experience.
④ Pat spawns are storymap style, so if the probability works out (and you're a lucky bastard) you could have all of the patriarchs spawn in the same room.
