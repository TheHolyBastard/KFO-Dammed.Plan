EXTERIOR:
==========================================================================================================
Should look dominating like this - https://i.imgur.com/sl0C3KC.jpeg
If you could open up the river a bit more next to the helicopter too
thats where i'd like the initial spawns.

Add collision Top of wall to prevent fp walking across to dam entrance.

Bridge Plan: 
    you know the metal girder thing
	sort of white with rust
	we can reskin it
	scale it bigger

	if you fuck around with the dimensions you could prob stretch it out to be the right shape
	just repeat a few times across the gap
	do the stone buttress things with bsp

	I want a way better skin though.

	and the top level of the bridge with bsp too

==========================================================================================================
STALKER ARENA:
==========================================================================================================
I want a heavy, dark, oppressive atmosphere
the atmos we had going on the earlier versions was actually better from what i can remember
^Fog effect.

Stalker Sex Dungeon:
25% chance to spawn grafitti on the cell at the very end of each intersection. 4-way cell cross.
no, but it doesn't necessarily have to be symmetrical.
the other corridors could look like repurposed store rooms or even caves

	what, with more cages? :P

	depends how much effort you want to put into it
	Ppl will just be glancing towards the end to see if theres a code, then never looking again
	though there's the off chance they might try to camp in there to try kill off all the stalkers
	so consider that with the layout too
	maybe put stalker spawns in the roofs of all the cells
	a vent or a hole or something
	that's where some of the trickle can come from
	
	also, the porn shoot room
    the guys at the dam seem to be using the area for recreational purposes, 
	so it might be woryh considering putting some kind of filming equipment storage room or closet
	doesn't need huge effort, just something basic.

==========================================================================================================
CRAWLER PIT:
==========================================================================================================
Progression = Hive style industrial walkways -> foreman office -> toilets -> Air Ducts -> canteen ->
		      extension room -> Hazard Room -> offices/Air Duct 2 -> Tilted room -> End.

Plan:
Top level - https://i.imgur.com/yKUe5lB.jpg
Lower flooded level - https://i.imgur.com/uQSQ8tf.jpg
Locker room at start with all weapons from previous level. 1-way small drop into main level. 
Regular wave level with some parkour. Top level has regular early wave spawns with various
holes in the floor or broken walkways and catwalks that need to be jumped across or avoided.

If you fall, you drop into the lower level which has knee-high murky water and is full of crawlers. 
LOTS of crawlers. Need to have slightly above 50% hp to survive fall. 
Can climb back up to top level via elevator near the start. Katana on lower level.
Grim, brighter lighting, experimental dust/halo mesh spanning almost entire level.

Toilet corridor:
so, thicker corridor, double doors at end, trap for noobs.
ventilation shaft to the left, to foreshadow other vents later on. 
It could angle upwards and would mostly just displace the old corridor that used to be there,
just a grating in the side of the wall that had fallen over, 
or could be removed via objective or something

The fuseboxes could be moved to the toilet corridor if you make more space

Hazard Room:
Decorated with pipes and grating, full of acid environmental damage (will change to electrical)
Requires careful navigation through a route and scripted zeds, drops down to offices.

Tilted Room:
Water pump obj - you could put a floating obj marker when you get near it maybe
				 anything else is just not very good so delete otherwise.

END: 
A broken stairwell, through a locked door that requires getting past a scrake and operating a keypad.

==========================================================================================================
TIGHT FP:
==========================================================================================================
	- use the narrow pipes from the wall near the start if the others dont look so good to you
	just needs to be enough to bump at a crucial second

	yup, just 1 is fine right?
	- put 2 or 3 along the length of the corridor

	1 fp bump that you know about is manageable, but lots would jsut be wipe/pain
	ugh
	xD

	- you could also put a slight dip down.

Tight FP Stair transitions:
https://i.imgur.com/coiUCTL.jpeg
Each stairwell could be a couple of flights of steps up.
At each platform there could be the classic barricade/burning
doorway from which zeds appear. Just trash.
maybe 1 or 2 sc

that central pillar on both stairs is just 1 bsp. So delete it, 
and replace it with metal grill/fence meshes that you can see through.
Assuming we put decorations there and everything...
  - maybe a mess of vertical pipes surrounded by mesh.
  -	speaking of that, could make all the spawn points in the stairs proximity-based,
	so that stuff is spawning on ppl if they try hide in the stairwells.

Inspiration:
KFO-RE-Mansion FP Basement.

==========================================================================================================
TURBINE ROOM:
==========================================================================================================
Plan:
Will look sorta like dis - https://c7.alamy.com/comp/E5BG8M/hoover-dam-turbine-room-E5BG8M.jpg
After checkpoint you traverse into lower turbine. Loose combat wave 
Upper area is restricted by some means (rubble?), 
until door bursts open and players can get out onto the side of the Dam Wall,
then break back into upper Dam wall.

Turbine Room Dimensions, idk, see what you think
main bsp subtract is: 1200 height, 4000 width, 800 breadth
	^Should have more breadth.

Lower Turbine:
I'm thinking few obstacles, but lotsa pipes and wiring for the turbines.
Maybe turbine slightly see-through? -> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110822682
									-> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110822936

Waves jumping down from side entrances and such but mostly spawns focused on other end
from entrance. 
After set amount of time a door right near the end can blow open or sommit, with specimen/fp 
breaking out. This is access to the Dam Wall -> Upper Turbine transition.

Upper Turbine:
A defined walkway, here spawns should hopefully get really intense so it needs to be wide.

obj = "Turbine Start-up Procedure: Stage 1/?"

people get lost on foundry because it doesn't make sense at all
same on kfo-west
	focus on killing zeds, turbine power up is just 3/3. Loud sound effects to clue you in
	sound design will be key probably. Even with obvious HUD people will ignore it
	official maps sort of work because voice-overs
	
	you can use engine sounds
	stack more as it powers up further
	maybe make some lights on it too.
	
==========================================================================================================
DAM WALL:
==========================================================================================================
Plan:
Spawns falling from top of wall, in front and behind.
Plenty husks, sirens, fp, scrakes, bloats to knock off into the abyss.
Burning city skyline art in background, or whirling blizzard.

Found equipment: Dwarfs Axe, ZED Blower, Seeker Six.

TLD Dam wall Preview - https://youtu.be/eRCB_8Cf0aQ?t=170

==========================================================================================================
PATRIARCH:
==========================================================================================================
Plan:
Helicopter on roof (via upper turbine -> dam wall access?) may have been blown up. D'oh. 
So players escape via train cutscene KFO-Transit style, This is accessed in an underground
train station via one last elevator or something fancy. 
Pre checkpoint and respawn before ofc but actual train station,
Could be power/fuel/weld objective where players have to work together and hold out.

When acheived, they escape via train and cutscene. Then Kevin reveals himself as a stowaway.
Players teleported to checkpoint secretly mid-cutscene in different section, aboard a "moving" train
with repeating scenery. Jump air resistance can be represented by horizontal PhsyicsVolume gravity.

Inspiration:
Taken from KF-Train, but improved, without the shitty scaling on meshes and other visual bugs hopefully!

Sidenote - Myrmuz did once suggest blowing up the Dam on the escape cutscene Half Life style.
           rip budget, wait a minute, what budget? When do I get paid?

==========================================================================================================
GENERAL IDEAS:
==========================================================================================================

Waterworks:
the helicopter crash has a big horizontal smoke emitter coming off it
various windows in the interior have a bright light with a similar smoke emitter
check em out
might be good ambience for our turbine room
if you can colour the smoke whitish it could look like frosty air

look on west streets
also mountainpass i think
kind of swirl emitters in the air.

==========================================================================================================
TO DO:
==========================================================================================================
- raising blocking volume in canteen (coz I forgot)
- reviewing new installed lights
- extensions + decorations for vent shafts (and replacing 2D fan)
- tight fp spawns
- Fix portals in crawler pit
- Fix player respawns
- Slop/biohazard room needs reviewing
- Dumb lever for the pump
- Review puter room objectives too.

Boss Arena:
 [h1][b]General Information[/b][/h1]
This remake fixes some nasty original map [b][i]features[/i][/b].
[spoiler]for more info spam comments section[/spoiler]
[list]
[*] Patriarch's spawn in tested, delayed intervals (usually as pairs).
[*] Built-in voteable Hard Mode.
[*] Amounts of dosh given feels more balanced.
[*] There's a second level, with planks, cover and all your wildest dreams.
[*] Additional armour and high tier weapon pickups (with consistent spawn % for all difficulties).
[*] Scripted pipe bombs near blocked off Patty spawns.
[*] Addressed zed pathing issues.
[*] And more fun additions such as a replacement for the siren wave.
[/list]


[h1][b]Whitelist Status[/b][/h1]

[*] Dedicated server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Listened server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Solo: (and you guessed it) Still whitelisted.

[h1][b]Technical Information[/b][/h1]
① This is simply a map, no embedded mutators or whatever. To edit/remove pipe bombs search for the tag "PipeSpawner" in the actor class browser and delete or navigate to the scripted triggers -> AI Script.
② 'SkipWave' event command will skip to next trader (but use at own risk on normal mode).
③ The optional Hard Mode features pat spawns without timed intervals, for the classic BossArena experience.
④ Pat spawns are storymap style, so if the probability works out (and you're a lucky bastard) you could have all of the patriarchs spawn in the same room.
